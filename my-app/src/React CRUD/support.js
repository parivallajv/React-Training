The goal was to make Flatbase a versatile solution, a support platform for articles and various other forms of media.

The knowledge base is expansive and informative. Flatbase also includes a Forum and FAQ section and other exciting features.

From purchase to website completion, only a few minutes need to pass.</p>

Ease of use and user-friendliness will always decide a websiteâ€™s success. With an added live search function based on AJAX, every visitor can access the section or features he wishes.
